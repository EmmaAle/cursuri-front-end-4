            <p><h4> Since i was a child i've allways liked to play on aplications
               pc games. Nowadays i don't play that much because i don't have
               but i have one or two apllication on my phone. Therefore playing
               on my pc or on my phone games was one of my hobbies when i was a
               child. In fact i was curios how big game companies like ubisouf
               EA manage to create them from scratch or Gameloft. From there
               began my passion for the IT field and i am now doing what i
               wanted to do from quite some time: taking some clases in order
               to be able to build my own aplication or websit.e

                as passionate about tehnologi as i am. Some of them are familiar
                with the class because they participated in similar classes and
                some of them are not and they are here like me to learn more.

                <p><h4>We are discovering new interesting things about websites.Is
                   not always easy because things get get complicated but who
                   sad that the things you like the most are always easy? If we
                   chose what we like no matter what people say things can be
                   much more easier than we think. For example i've always liked
                   editing videos or audious using wondershare filmora or pictures
                   picture with photoshop and i don't thinks is so hard once you
                   get the hang of it and most importantly you enjoy doing it.Here
                   one of my edited videos and my favourite. Enjoy!
